I'm currently working on [tracking ICE raids](https://ai-melts-ice.ml) with deep
learning.
If you'd be interested in helping grow this project, please reach out.


I'm working on a set of reinforcement learning agents who live in the browser.
Their environment/bodies were written with Paper.js, and their RL algorithms
(q-learning, shallow deep learning) were written from scratch.
I'm creating a LIF spiking neural network agent and would love some tips.
