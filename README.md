I'm currently working on [tracking ICE raids](https://ai-melts-ice.ml) with deep
learning. If you'd be interested in helping grow this project, please reach out.


I'm also making on a set of reinforcement learning agents that live in the browser.
Their environment/bodies have been written with Paper.js, and their RL algorithms
(q-learning, shallow deep learning) use Math.js for matrix operations.
I've been trying to create a LIF spiking neural network agent and would love some tips.
