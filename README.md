#### right now,
I'm exploring the benefits of spiking neural networks in the realm of reinforcement learning under LXAI's mentorship program,
I'm contributing to [pdq](https://github.com/ProofDrivenQuerying/pdq),
and I'm a software engineer at JPMorgan Chase & Co.

#### in my projects,
I [predict ICE arrests](https://ai-melts-ice.ml) with deep
learning, and I make web-based RL agents that employ a variety of learning algorithms
([q-learning](https://camilodoa.ml/ra), [deep q networks](https://camilodoa.ml/dra)).
