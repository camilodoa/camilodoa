*he/him*

#### right now,
I'm using spiking neural networks to solve reinforcement learning problems,
I'm contributing to [pdq](https://github.com/ProofDrivenQuerying/pdq),
and I'm a software engineer at JPMorgan Chase & Co.

#### in my projects,
I [predict ICE arrests](https://ai-melts-ice.ml) with deep
learning, and I make web-based reinforcement learning agents that employ a variety of learning algorithms
([q-learning](https://camilodoa.ml/ra) and [dqn](https://camilodoa.ml/dra)).
