I like training artificial neural nets.

I'm currently working on [tracking ICE raids](https://ai-melts-ice.ml) with deep learning. If you'd be interested in helping grow this project, please reach out.

I'm also making a zoo of reinforcement learning agents that live in the browser as a way to keep up with new advances in the field.

Completed:
- [Ra](https://camilodoa.ml/ra), a q-learning agent
- [Dra](https://camilodoa.ml/dra), a deep reinforcement learning agent

Upcoming:
- [Pc-rl](https://github.com/camilodoa/pcrl), a deep rl agent trained with novel [predictive coding techniques](https://openreview.net/forum?id=PdauS7wZBfC)
