#### right now,
I'm exploring the benefits of spiking neural networks in the realm of reinforcement learning under LXAI's mentorship program,
I'm contributing to [pdq](https://github.com/ProofDrivenQuerying/pdq),
And I'm a software engineer at JPMorgan Chase & Co.

#### in my projects,
I [track ICE raids](https://ai-melts-ice.ml) with deep
learning. If you'd be interested in helping grow this project, please reach out.

I also make web-based reinforcement learning agents.
My agents are animated with Paper.js, and their RL algorithms
([q-learning](https://camilodoa.ml/ra), [deep q networks](https://camilodoa.ml/dra)) are implemented from scratch.
